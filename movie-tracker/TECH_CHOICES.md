# Technology Stack Decisions

## Core Technologies

### React + TypeScript
1. **Why React?**
   - Large ecosystem and community support
   - Proven track record in production
   - Component-based architecture for reusability
   - Virtual DOM for efficient rendering
   - Strong developer tooling

2. **Why TypeScript?**
   - Type safety reduces runtime errors
   - Better IDE support and autocompletion
   - Enhanced code maintainability
   - Improved team collaboration through explicit interfaces
   - Better refactoring capabilities

### Vite
1. **Why Vite over Create React App or Next.js?**
   - Extremely fast development server
   - Modern build tooling with esbuild
   - Native ESM support
   - Optimized production builds
   - Simple configuration
   - No server-side rendering needed for this application

### Tailwind CSS
1. **Why Tailwind over other solutions?**
   - Utility-first approach speeds up development
   - No context switching between files
   - Small production bundle size
   - Highly customizable
   - Built-in responsive design
   - No need for CSS-in-JS solutions
   - Eliminates naming conventions debates

## State Management

### TanStack Query (React Query)
1. **Why TanStack Query over Redux or others?**
   - Built specifically for async data management
   - Automatic caching and invalidation
   - Built-in loading and error states
   - Optimistic updates
   - Minimal boilerplate
   - Perfect for REST API interactions
   - No need for complex state management as most state is server state

## Backend Choice

### Supabase
1. **Why Supabase over custom backend?**
   - PostgreSQL database with full SQL capabilities
   - Built-in authentication system
   - Row Level Security for data protection
   - Real-time subscriptions
   - Automatic REST API generation
   - Cost-effective scaling
   - Reduced development time
   - No need to maintain server infrastructure

2. **Why not Firebase?**
   - SQL vs NoSQL (PostgreSQL offers better structure)
   - More flexible querying capabilities
   - Better pricing model
   - Open source
   - No vendor lock-in
   - Direct database access

3. **Why not a custom Node.js backend?**
   - Would require additional hosting
   - More maintenance overhead
   - Authentication would need to be built
   - Would need to implement security measures
   - More complex deployment
   - Higher costs

## Testing Framework

### Vitest + React Testing Library
1. **Why Vitest?**
   - Native Vite integration
   - Faster than Jest
   - Compatible with Jest's API
   - Better ESM support
   - Watch mode performance

2. **Why React Testing Library?**
   - Encourages testing user behavior over implementation
   - Simple and intuitive API
   - Promotes accessibility
   - Strong community support
   - Works well with TypeScript

## UI Components

### Lucide React
1. **Why Lucide over other icon libraries?**
   - Lightweight
   - Tree-shakeable
   - Consistent design
   - MIT licensed
   - Good TypeScript support
   - Regular updates
   - No additional styling needed

### Custom Components over UI Libraries
1. **Why build custom over Material-UI or others?**
   - Better bundle size
   - Full design control
   - No design system constraints
   - Simpler maintenance
   - No version conflicts
   - Better performance
   - Tailwind CSS makes it easy

## Form Validation

### Zod
1. **Why Zod over Yup or others?**
   - First-class TypeScript support
   - Runtime type checking
   - Automatic type inference
   - Smaller bundle size
   - More intuitive API
   - Better error messages
   - Active maintenance

## API Integration

### TMDB API
1. **Why TMDB over other movie APIs?**
   - Comprehensive movie database
   - Well-documented API
   - Free for non-commercial use
   - Regular updates
   - High-quality images
   - Rich metadata
   - Good rate limits

## Development Tools

### ESLint + TypeScript ESLint
1. **Why this combination?**
   - Strong static analysis
   - TypeScript-aware linting
   - Customizable rules
   - Integrates with IDEs
   - Catches common mistakes
   - Enforces consistent code style

## Recommendation System

### Custom ML Implementation
1. **Why custom over existing solutions?**
   - Better control over algorithm
   - Can optimize for specific use case
   - No external dependencies
   - Runs in browser
   - Easy to modify and improve
   - Learning opportunity
   - No API costs

## Future Considerations
